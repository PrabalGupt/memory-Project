req (Request Object):
        req contains information about the HTTP request made by the client. It includes data such as parameters, query strings, headers, and the request body. Developers use req to access and process data sent by the client.
res (Response Object):
        res is the object used to send a response back to the client. It provides methods for sending data, setting headers, and managing the response. In the code snippet, res.send("Hello World"); is used to send the string "Hello World" as the response to the client.
